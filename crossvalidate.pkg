d 'CROSSVALIDATE': A suite of tools for cross-validation in Stata
d
d crossvalidate is a package containing several commands to enable users to 
d implement multiple cross-validation procedures with estiamtion commands in 
d Stata.  There are two prefix commands -xv- and -xvloo- that are used to 
d implement the entire cross-validation pipeline with the estimation command 
d supplied by the user.  For users that require more fine-grained control over 
d the cross-validation process, the commands -splitit2-, -fitit-, -predictit-, &
d -validateit- implement each phase of cross-validation discretely.  There are 
d also several utility commands included as well.  Lastly, the included Mata 
d library contains over 40 different evaluation functions covering binary and 
d multi-class classification models and continuous outcome models.  If you only 
d intend to use the -xv- and -xvloo- prefix commands, they should work without 
d any further steps.  If, however, you wish to use the lower-level commands, you 
d will need to call the libxv command first to compile the Mata library on your 
d machine.
