![Stata Crossvalidation](crossvalidate-hex.png)
# crossvalidation
The crossvalidate package includes several commands and a Mata library that 
provide a range of possible cross-validation techniques that can be used with 
any Stata estimation command returning results in `e()`.  For the majority of 
users and use cases, the prefix commands (see `xv` and `xvloo`) should handle 
your needs.  If, however, you need to implement something a bit different from 
generic use cases, the package also includes lower level commands that can save 
you time from having to code the entire cross-validation process.  These 
commands are named after the four-steps found in all cross-validation work:
`splitit2`, `fitit`, `predictit`, and `validateit`.  There are also a few utility 
commands that take care of the metaprogramming tasks needed to allow these 
commands to be applied to the correct fold/split of the data.

Lastly, we implemented the majority of validation metrics that can be found in 
the R package [yardstick](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/index.html) in our 
Mata library so you don't have to.  However, if you want to implement your own 
validation metric that is possible and easy to do (see information below which 
specifies the function signature to use for your Mata function that will 
implement your metric) and easy to use with the existing tools (i.e., pass the 
name of your function as an argument to the `metric` or `monitors` options of 
either the prefix commands or `validateit` and it will handle the rest).

## Examples:

```
// Load example dataset
sysuse auto.dta, clear

// Simple train/test (TT) split
xv 0.8, pstub(ttpred) metric(mse): reg price mpg length

// Simple train/validation/test (TVT) split
xv 0.6 0.2, pstub(tvtpred) metric(mse) monitors(mape smape): reg price mpg length

// Leave-One-Out cross valiation with a train/test split
xvloo 0.8, pstub(ttloopred) metric(mse): reg price mpg length

// LOO TVT split
xvloo 0.6 0.2, pstub(tvtloopred) metric(mse): reg price mpg length

// K-Fold TT split
xv 0.8, pstub(ttkfpred) metric(mae) kfold(5): reg price mpg length if !mi(rep78)

// K-Fold TVT split
xv 0.6 0.2, pstub(tvtkfpred) metric(mbe) kfold(3): reg price mpg length, vce(rob)

// Clustered K-Fold TT Split
xv 0.8, metric(phl) uid(rep78) kfold(4) display retain: reg price mpg length, vce(rob)

```

## TODO
- [ ] Standardize language in help files
- [x] Finish writing test cases for ADO commands
- [x] Adding optional arguments to continuous metrics where possible
- [ ] Adding optional arguments to binary metrics where possible
- [ ] Adding optional arguments to multiclass metrics where possible

# libxv

## Metrics/Monitors

### Method Signature
The program will allow users to define their own metrics/monitors that are not 
contained in libcrossvalidate.  In order to do this, users must implement a 
specific method/function signature:

```
real scalar metric(string scalar pred, string scalar obs, 
				   string scalar touse, | transmorphic matrix opts)
```				   

The function must return a real valued scalar and take three arguments.  The 
three arguments are used to access the data that would be used to compute the 
metrics/monitors and to provide a method to pass optional arguments to the 
underlying functions if supported.

### Data access
Within the function body, we recommend using the following pattern to access 
the data needed to compute any metrics/monitors:

```
real colvector yhat, y
yhat = st_data(., pred, touse)
y = st_data(., obs, touse)
```

The programs in the cross validate package will handle the construction of the 
variables and passing them to the function name that users pass to the programs. 

### Building the library
Once we are ready to build the Mata library we should do the following using an 
instance of Stata 15.

```
// Clear everything out of Mata
mata: mata clear 

// Define all of the Mata functions in memory
run crossvalidate.mata

// If the library is already built, use this instead:
lmbuild libxv, replace dir(`"`c(pwd)'"')
```

function.  Optional arguments for the metric function can be passed as a matrix.  
For example, metric(ccc((1))) or metric(ccc(("y"))).  See help documentation 
for cases where options are supported, as well as the required format for those 
options.
* <ins>kf</ins>old(_integer_) - An optional parameter that implements K-Fold 
cross-validation with the number of folds specified by the user.  The default is 
1, which is the equivalent of simple train/test or train/validation/test splits.

to `split` is _xvsplit.

provided cannot end in a number. If a value is passed to the `split`, `pstub`,

the default is xvfit and only applies to users of Stata 17 and above.
